    "The RMSE went down by about $1,000. This is a huge improvement compared to our baseline of 3331.90. Obviously the reason why RF is performing better is because it handles nonlinear data better than LR, it also aggregates many trees and reduces the variance. It also is more robust to overfitting and would perform better than a single tree like Decision Tree Regression. Next is to use gradient boosting which is a more powerful and faster and should improve the quality and speed of the predictions"

    "#### Evauluation Metric\n",
    "We used RMSE as our evaluation metric as it measures the average prediction error, and in our case, average prediction error in euros. As such, lower RMSE \n",
    "means the more accurate the model was.\n",

    "|  Tuned LightGBM | 2307.97 |\n",
    "| CatBoost | 2376.05 |\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Findings\n",
    "- Linear Regression has the worst RMSE, which is to be expected since it doesn't handle non-linear relationships very well\n",
    "- Random Forest with tuning had the best RMSE\n",
    "- LightGBM with tuning was a very close second to Random Forest with an almost identical performance\n",

    "| CatBoost | 2.8 | 0.02 |\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Interpretation\n",
    "- While ensemble methods like Random Forest and gradient boosting models significantly improved prediction accuracy over Linear Regression, they required longer training times. Among the boosting models, LightGBM offered a good balance between training time and accuracy, while CatBoost provided very fast prediction times. In production scenarios where prediction latency is critical, CatBoost could be preferable despite slightly higher RMSE."
